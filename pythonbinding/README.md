# Python Binding of the Mu Client API

The Python binding allows the client to be written in Python. This binding is
based on the `ctypes` module and is tested on Python 2, Python 3, PyPy and
PyPy3.

It depends on the C binding. You need to build the C binding in the
`../cbinding` directory before using this Python binding.

# How to use
