# Python Binding of the Mu Client API

The Python binding allows the client to be written in Python. This binding is
based on the `ctypes` module. Currently only the Python 2 binding is available.

It depends on the C binding. You need to build the C binding in the
`../cbinding` directory before using this Python binding.

# How to use

See the docstring in `libmupython2.py`
